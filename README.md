# TI-BASIC code

This is a collection of some of the TI-BASIC code I wrote in 2007-2008.
It's presented unedited, as it was written when I was in middle school.

I'm sorry.

## File conversion

TI-BASIC programs, when copied to the PC from a TI calculator using
[TI-Graph Link](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/A2E9B3DFCB44490DBD5449E05721767D/ti-graph-link-for-windows),
are stored in the encoded, unreadable file format `8xp`. Luckily,
someone wrote [this converter](http://ti.zewaren.net/en/portal-ti83-ti83plus-ti83plusse.php)
so anyone can convert an `8xp` file into plain text.

Unfortunately this converter does not correctly handle a number of
special characters. #1 gives some details on this issue.
